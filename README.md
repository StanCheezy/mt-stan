# Machine Translation With Sequence To Sequence Models And Dot Attention Mechanism
This repo will consist of the pre-trained model from "https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/mbart" which was initailly built for learning purposes. The Models were trained for many hours on differetn several languages.
Note: This is to inform anyone with access to my repo that some of the code in this repo are purely modified with my data


This repo is for readers from the blogpost linked here:  
https://blog.paperspace.com/nlp-machine-translation-with-keras/
The above blog contains code for training a model using Pythons Keras Library. 

Use this notebook to follow along and reproduce the materials found in the blog
